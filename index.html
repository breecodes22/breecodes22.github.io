    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>From launching the first predictive analytics models for care at Epic Systems to now, I have been captivated by the ways to use cutting-edge technologies like AI/ML and automation to improve patient access to care. I am guided by the belief that every person should have affordable and accessible quality healthcare when needed.
Here are the problems I'm working to solve in my career:
Why is medical care in the U.S.A. some of the best in the world, but access to care is not?
Why do over 80% of medical bills contain errors?
Why has AI not been adopted widely in the healthcare industry?
I love to connect with others working on these problems, or are interested in discussing how to improve these areas in the future. Please reach out!</p>
